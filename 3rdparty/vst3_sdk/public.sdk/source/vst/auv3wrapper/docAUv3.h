\brief
Helper Class wrapping a VST 3 plug-in to a Audio Unit v3 plug-in

***************************
\section AUv3Introduction Introduction
***************************
The VST 3 SDK comes with a helper class which wraps one VST 3 Audio Processor and Edit Controller to
a AUv3 plug-in.

The wrapped AudioUnit does support MPE when the VST3 plug-in has Note Expression support. You need
to implement \ref Steinberg::Vst::INoteExpressionPhysicalUIMapping to map your Note Expression to
the limited three expressions defined by MPE.
\n

\section howtoAUv3 How does it work?
***************************
- Structure:
    - App          (container app which initializes the AU through small Playback Engine)
    - Extension    (extension which is loaded by hosts, also initializes the AU)

- How-To use the VST3->AUv3 Wrapper with the sample code:

    - make sure you have correct code signing set up

    - build & run targets

- How-To use the VST3->AUv3 Wrapper with your own VST Plugin:

    - duplicate either the folder again_auv3 or note_expression_synth_auv3 in public.sdk/samples/vst,
      rename it as you like and edit the CMakelist.txt to add your sources, resources and modify target
      names etc.

    - take special attention to the stuff in audiounitconfig.h and change the definitions in
      there.

    - also change the other files in that folder to your needs. -Code signing is required, but you
      can build and test with a developer only identity.

    - build & run targets
