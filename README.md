for standalone:

* GNU/Linux operating system
* Jack server running

for plugin:

 * GNU/Linux or Windows operating system.
 * A host that supports LV2 or VST3 plugin format.

## Build & Install

##### Install dependencies

In order to build Geonkick there is a need to install
the following development packages:

* libsndfile
* RapidJSON
* JACK Audio Connection Kit
* LV2 development library

On Debian, Ubuntu, Ubuntu Studio install:

    apt-get install build-essential cmake libjack-dev libsndfile-dev rapidjson-dev lv2-dev libcairo2-dev

##### Build & install Geonkick

Clone the Geonkick code repository, compile and install.

        copy the source code of the latest release
        mkdir geonkick/build
        cd geonkick/build
        cmake ../
        make
        make install

##### Build Geonkick with VST3 Plugin

Get VST3 SDK than build Geonkick VST3 plugin:

        mkdir geonkick/build
        cd geonkick/build
        cmake -DVST3_SDK_PATH=<full system path to VST3 SDK folder> -DSMTG_ENABLE_VST3_PLUGIN_EXAMPLES=OFF -DSMTG_ENABLE_VST3_HOSTING_EXAMPLES=OFF -DSMTG_ENABLE_VSTGUI_SUPPORT=OFF ../
        make
        make install

##### Building on Windows

To build on Windows, there is a need to install MSYS2/UCRT64 and follow
the same steps as mentioned above.
