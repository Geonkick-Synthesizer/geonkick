# Geonkick

Geonkick - a [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) percussion synthesizer.

Geonkick is a synthesizer that can synthesize elements
of percussion. The most basic examples are: kicks,
snares, hit-hats, shakers, claps.

"Geon" in the name "Geonkick" refers to a hypothetical particle called "geon".

     - FLAC: 16, 24 bit
     - Ogg
* Open & Save presets in JSON format
* Preset browser
* Standalone
* Pitch to note
* LV2 Plugin
     - "Single" version that supports one
       instrument and one stereo channel per instance.
     - The default version that supports kits of 16 instruments
       and 16 output stereo channels per instance.
* Platforms:
     - GNU/Linux
* Manually scale the UI by factor of 2 (useful for HiDPI cases)

#### Technical limitations

 - Supports only GNU/Linux and LV2 plugin format.
 - Can run properly only at 48000 sample rate. It will run also at other sample
   rates but the sound will seem pitch shifted up / down.
 - Doesn't support velocity expression for synthesizer parameters
   (nor for layers), only for total instrument amplitude.
 - The default plugin version (that supports kits) will take per instance
   about 35 MB from the heap. The "Single" version of the plugin will
   take about 2 MB per plugin instance. If only one instrument per track is used,
   it is recommended to use the "Single" version of the plugin.
 - Doesn't support automation of parameters.
 - Doesn't support BÃ©zier curves for envelopes.
 - UI can be scaled, but it will be blurred
 - Filters become unstable for some extremal combination of cutoff and
   resonance parameter.

#### Requirements

In order Geonkick to run and operate correctly there is a need:

for standalone:

* GNU/Linux operating system
* Jack server running at 48000 sample rate

for plugin:

 * GNU/Linux operating system.
 * A host that supports LV2 plugin format running at 48000 sample rate.

#### Install

##### Install dependencies

In order to build Geonkick there is a need to install the following development packages:

* [Redkite](https://github.com/iurie-sw/redkite) GUI toolkit (use release version, see tags).
* libsndfile
* RapidJSON (version >= 1.1)
* JACK Audio Connection Kit (optional if building only for plugin)
* LV2 development library

On Debian, Ubuntu, Ubuntu Studio install:

    build and install first Redkite, than:
    apt-get install build-essential
    apt-get install cmake
    apt-get install qjackctl libjack-dev libsndfile-dev
    apt-get install rapidjson-dev
    apt-get install lv2-dev

##### Build & install Geonkick

Clone the Geonkick code repository, compile and install.

Note: Use the release version (see tags).

        git clone https://gitlab.com/iurie-sw/geonkick.git
        mkdir geonkick/build
        cd geonkick/build
        cmake ../
        make
        make install

#### Packages

Geonkick can be found in the repository of ArchLinux, OpenSUSE, Fedora
, Manjaro, FreeBSD, KXStudio and Ubuntu Studio.

##### Packaging

Please, use only the release versions for packaging, and build against only the release version of Redkite.
If Redkite GUI toolkit is installed in a different location
than the standard ones there is a need to set GKICK_REDKITE_SDK_PATH
to point to the needed location.
